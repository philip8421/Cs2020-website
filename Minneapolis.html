    <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longtime activist Sandra Richardson was on a walk with her husband last Monday evening through the Minneapolis neighborhood where she grew up. What she didn’t realize until the next morning was that during her walk, just blocks away, a black man named George Floyd was dying as a police officer knelt on his neck and onlookers pleaded with the officer to get off him.<br><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richardson later watched the video in horror, like millions of others since, as Floyd had his life taken away from him by an officer with a “very nonchalant attitude” not far from her home. She wasn’t surprised when the city erupted in mass protest soon after. “If you talk to enough people in Minneapolis, it wasn’t if this was going to happen. It was when,” Richardson, who has worked against inequality in the city for years with the People’s Institute for Survival and Beyond, an anti-racist community organization, says. “You can only demean people so much until they respond.”<br><br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For activists like Richardson, it’s no surprise to find Minneapolis at the center of the national uprising underway. The city, they say, has a long record of police brutality that is symptomatic of broader racial injustice issues that go back generations. For years, Minneapolis’ large network of activists and organizers have been fighting for reforms to help close the poverty gap for the black community, and demanding the city stop increasing the budget of the police department, which they say targets members of their communities. They’ve held press conferences. They’ve gone to city council meetings. They’ve lobbied the state legislature. And they’ve cautioned what could happen if officials don’t tackle the twin crises of economic disparity and what they say is an overly aggressive police force.<br><br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The reality is that our city and Minneapolis and elected officials were warned several years ago that this was likely to happen if they did not rein in the Minneapolis police department and also address the economic inequality that African-Americans here face,” says Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights attorney and founder of the Racial Justice Network. “They failed to take action and so this is really the outcome of that.”<br><br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Black Lives Matter movement took hold nationally after Eric Garner and Michael Brown died at the hands of police in 2014, solidarity protests also broke out in Minnesota. Demonstrators occupied the Mall of America, a major regional attraction, and shut down major highways. The next year, protests erupted again after police shot and killed Jamar Clark, an unarmed black man, in North Minneapolis, and in 2016, after a police officer shot and killed Philando Castile, whose girlfriend live streamed part of the incident in a Minneapolis suburb. In both cases, there was no police conviction.<br><br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men’s deaths led to a groundswell of local organizing. Protesters held an 18-day encampment in Minneapolis’s Fourth Police Precinct for Clark and a weeks-long occupation of the governor’s mansion for Castile. Local groups and projects sprouted up, like the Twin Cities Coalition for Justice 4 Jamar and MPD150, a loose collection of local activists that support dismantling the police force and who created a people’s history of the Minneapolis Police Department that coincided with its 150th anniversary. “We’ve been doing anti-police brutality organizing in Minneapolis pretty much straight since Jamar Clark’s killing in 2015,” says Tony Williams, an MPD150 contributor and member of Reclaim the Block, a group that focuses on policy organizing. “That was the point at which we realized that this place could be a flashpoint in the same way as anywhere else.”<br><br>
